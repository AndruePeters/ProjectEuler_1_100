# ProjectEuler_1_100
Solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems.

## Build System
    * From root, run:
        * `cmake -Bbuild`
        * `cmake --build build -- -j4`
    * Now, all binaries should be in build/bin

## Structure
    * Each problem has its folder
    * The problem solution itself is compiled as a static library
    * There is a benchmarks file associated with each problem.
        * Each benchmarks file is included in the master at src/benchmark.cpp
    * Each problem has a main associated to verify the output.

## Solved Problems
    * Problem 1
    * Problem 2
